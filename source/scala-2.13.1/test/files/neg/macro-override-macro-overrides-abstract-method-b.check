Test_2.scala:3: error: <$anon: C with A> inherits conflicting members:
  macro override def t(): Unit (defined in trait C) and
  def t(): Unit (defined in trait A)
  (note: this can be resolved by declaring an `override` in <$anon: C with A>.)
  val c2 = new C with A {}
               ^
Test_2.scala:5: error: macro can only be overridden by another macro:
macro override def t(): Unit (defined in trait C)
  val c4 = new C with A { override def t(): Unit = () }
                                       ^
